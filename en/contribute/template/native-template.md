## Module Comments

```
/**
 * @addtogroup Module name
 * @{
 * 
 * @brief Outline the functionality of the module in one sentence.
 * 
 * Describe the main functionalities, use scenarios, and use suggestions of the module. Focus on the logical concepts involved in this module, their relationships, and their functionalities in an application.
 * For example, for choreographer, describe its functionalities and how to use it.
 * Choreographer orchestrates the timing of frame rendering. It is a C implementation in Java. Applications can use choreographer to arrange the proper timing of frame rendering as follows:
 * 1. Register a callback function with choreographer.
 * 2. The callback function is called when it is time to start the next frame, with the FrameCallbackData parameter returned.
 * 3. Perform processing on the callback.
 * 4. The SF performs conversion based on the return value of the callback.
 * In the detailed description, if there are multiple paragraphs, end each paragraph with \n.\n

 * In the detailed description, if there are multiple paragraphs, end each paragraph with \n.\n
 * 
 * @param (Optional) Followed by the parameter name and description. Use one @param tag for each parameter. If the function does not have parameters, delete the tag.
