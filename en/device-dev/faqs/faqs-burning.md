### What should I do when the image failed to be burnt?<a name="section1370982513317"></a>

-   **Symptom**

    The burning status is not displayed after clicking  **Burn**  and selecting a serial port.

-   **Possible Causes**

    The IDE is not restarted after the DevEco plug-in is installed.

-   **Solutions**

    Restart the IDE.


### What should I do when no command output is displayed?<a name="section183421944953"></a>

-   **Symptom**

    The serial port shows that the connection has been established. After the board is restarted, nothing is displayed when you press  **Enter**.

-   **Possible Cause 1**

    The serial port is connected incorrectly.

-   **Solutions**

    Change the serial port number.

    Start  **Device Manager**  to check whether the serial port connected to the board is the same as that connected to the terminal device. If the serial ports are different, perform step 1 in the  **Running an Image**  section to change the serial port number.


-   **Possible Cause 2**

    The U-Boot of the board is damaged.

-   **Solutions**

    Burn the U-Boot.

    If the fault persists after you perform the preceding operations, the U-Boot of the board may be damaged. You can burn the U-Boot by performing the following steps:


1.  Obtain the U-Boot file.

    >![](../public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE** 
    >The U-Boot file of the two boards can be obtained from the following paths, respectively.
    >Hi3516D V300:  **device\\hisilicon\\hispark\_taurus\\sdk\_liteos\\uboot\\out\\boot\\u-boot-hi3516dv300.bin**
    >Hi3518E V300:  **device\\hisilicon\\hispark\_aries\\sdk\_liteos\\uboot\\out\\boot\\u-boot-hi3518ev300.bin**

2.  Burn the U-Boot file by following the procedures for burning a U-Boot file over USB.

    Select the U-Boot files of corresponding development boards for burning by referring to  [Programming Flash Memory on the Hi3516](../quick-start/quickstart-lite-steps-hi3516-running.md)/[Programming Flash Memory on the Hi3518](../quick-start/quickstart-ide-lite-steps-hi3516-burn.md)

3.  Log in to the serial port after the burning is complete.

### What should I do when the Windows computer failed to be connected to the board?<a name="section1215410450215"></a>

-   **Symptom**

    The file image cannot be obtained after clicking  **Burn**  and selecting a serial port.

    ![](figures/failed-to-obtain-the-image-file-due-to-unavailable-connection.png "failed-to-obtain-the-image-file-due-to-unavailable-connection")

-   **Possible Causes**

    The board is disconnected from the Windows computer.

    Windows Firewall does not allow Visual Studio Code to access the network.

-   **Solutions**

1.  Check whether the network cable is properly connected.
2.  Click  **Windows Firewall**.

### The Development Board Failed to Be Identified by the Burning Tool

- **Symptom**

  During image burning, the burning tool displays a message indicating that no device is found.

- **Possible Causes**

  The cable between the Windows computer and the development board is not connected. (The cable required varies. In this example, the USB cable is used.) 

  The driver corresponding to the cable between the Windows computer and the development board is not installed.

- **Solution**

  1. Make sure the cable between the Windows computer and the development board is connected.

  2. Open Device Manager in Windows.

  3. Open the Universal Serial Bus controllers list.

  4. Check whether the USB device driver has been installed. If an alarm is displayed, the driver has not been installed.

  5. Depending on the Windows environment, install the desired USB device driver, such as FT23R USB UART Driver. Then try again.

  6. If any other issue occurs, consult the relevant FAQ entry.
